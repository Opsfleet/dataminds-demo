# Streamlit UI User Guide

## How the UI Works

### Sending Messages

1. **Write your question** in the text input area
2. **Press Enter** to create a new line within your message
3. **Press Send Button** to send your message to the agent

### Message Formatting

You can use markdown format in your messages to include:
- **Code blocks** for sharing code snippets
- **Tables** for structured data
- **Bulleted lists** for organizing information
- **Numbered lists** for step-by-step instructions
- And other markdown formatting options

### Viewing Responses

1. **Messages appear** in real-time as the agent processes your request
2. **Tool boxes** are displayed when the agent uses various tools
3. **After tool execution completes**, you can expand the tool boxes to see exactly what tools were used and what parameters used for tool.

This interface provides a seamless way to interact with the AI agent while giving you full visibility into the tools and processes being used to answer your questions.
